# TradingViewMessageSender
Send Messages to the followers of special users

The program works in two tabs, in first one you can send messages to the followers of specific users and also you can import a text file including the usernames to send message to.
Tool needs to work with database, some usernames and password for diffirent discord accounts needs to be added to the database so tradingview will not think that its spam.
In the second tab, you can send to followers of multiple usernames.
